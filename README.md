# Code

- [00_rowbinddata.ipynb](https://github.com/eunice30718/QSS20_TEXTASDATA_PROJ/blob/main/code/00_rowbinddata.ipynb)
  - Takes in following files stored on Github or in Dropbox:
    - `H-2A_Disclosure_Data_FY[].xlsx`: data containing FY 2020 and FY 21 Q1 H2A job clearances
    - `FOIA_2021-F-05932_raw_data.xlsx`: data from FOIA request on addendums; stored in a couple sheets
  - What it does:
    - Reads in the different job disclosure datafiles and rowbinds
    - Rowbinds the different files of the Excel addendums sheet
  - Outputs to Dropbox:
    - `H-2A_Disclosure_Data_FY_combined_202021Q1.csv`: rowbound job disclosures
    - `FOIA_2021-F-05932_raw_data_combined_202021Q1.csv`: rowbound job addendums

- [01_sampledescriptives.ipynb](https://github.com/eunice30718/QSS20_TEXTASDATA_PROJ/blob/main/code/01_sampledescriptives.ipynb)

  - Takes in::
    - Rowbound outputs of previous scripts
  - What it does:
    - Concatenates addendums within the same job clearance number (`CASE_NUMBER`) across sections
    - Detects for spanish phrases and removes aggregated addendums with any Spanish
    - Left joins job disclosures to addendums and creates indicator for disclosures without any text addendum
    - Compares attributes of jobs with and without addendums
    - For text analysis, does inner join of disclosures to addendums (so only retains jobs with English addendums)
  - Outputs to Dropbox:
    - `merged_addendums_jobdisclosures[csv|pkl]`: csv and pkl format of inner join for text analysis

- [02_textpreprocess_topicmod.ipynb](https://github.com/eunice30718/QSS20_TEXTASDATA_PROJ/blob/main/code/02_textpreprocess_topicmod.ipynb)

  - Takes in::
    - Merged jobs and addendums from previous script
  - What it does:
    - Calculates top words in each corpus
    - Provides a template to investigate  top words of interest
    - Creates a topic model using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm
    - Creates visualizations of top words for given topics
