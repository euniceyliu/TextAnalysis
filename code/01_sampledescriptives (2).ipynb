Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.131(a-b), all temporary labor certifications issued to the Association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its members. Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.131(b), workers authorized by the temporary labor certification may be transferred among its certified employer members to perform work for which the temporary labor certification was granted. The Association will control the assignment of workers authorized by the temporary labor certification &amp; maintain records of such assignments, &amp; may as allowed by the regulation, transfer workers among its certified employer members as needed, from time to time, during the period of employment, to perform the work for which the temporary labor certification was granted. The actual number of workers employed in the certified job opportunities of  an Association member at any given time may be more or less than the approximate numbers shown in the addendum, depending upon real time conditions, including, but not limited to, crop conditions, weather, markets or other circumstances that develop during the course of the growing season. The number of workers requested in Section A.2 of the ETA Form 790 is not the sum total of the approximate number of workers (foreign &amp; domestic) shown in the addendum because workers may work for more than one employer member over the course of the employment period.  || Pruning Tomato Plants - $.40/100 row ft.                           \\t\\t$12.67  Picking Cherry Tomatoes - $2.00 5/8 bu.                          \\t\\t$12.67  Picking Green Tomatoes - $.40 5/8 bu.                               \\t\\t$12.67  Picking Pink Tomatoes - $.50 5/8 bu.                                 \\t\\t$12.67  Picking Roma Tomatoes - $.70 5/8 bu.                               \\t\\t$12.67  Pulling Turnips - $.80 - 5/8 bu.                                        \\t\\t$12.67Sweet Corn Harvest- $12.67 per hour\\t\\t\\t\\t$12.67  Blackberry - 8 ? 12 oz. clam shells $3.50\\t\\t\\t\\t$12.67  Blackberry - 12 ? 6 oz. clam shells $3.00\\t\\t\\t\\t$12.67  Blackberry - 6 ? 18 oz. clam shells $3.80\\t\\t\\t\\t$12.67  The bins used for apple harvest are Macro Plastics Model 32. The dimensions of this model are 41 5/8? (L) x 45 1/8?(W) x 24 3/8?(H).The tasks listed above will be paid at the above listed piece rates whenever possible. In instances when, in the employer's judgment, working conditions are unusually adverse, the employer may, in its discretion, temporarily raise the piece rate above the rates listed above, or may elect to pay workers at the applicable hourly AEWR rate, in order to assure workers fair earnings. None of the tasks listed above will be paid at less than the above-listed piece rates.           When picking pickle cucumbers each worker will be paid a minimum of $.75 per 5/8 bushel bucket for all buckets picked during the pay period &amp; will be guaranteed the AEWR; however the workers earnings will be based on the various sizes of the cucumbers picked each day by the total crew. Each bucket picked will include cucumbers of all marketable sizes. These full buckets picked by all pickers in the crew will be dumped in a common field bin. The worker will be given a token or ticket for each 5/8 bushel bucket dumped in the bin. The cucumbers will be taken to the grading station operated by the company that buys the pickles grown by the Employer. The buyer's grading machine separates by size the pickles furnished by the Employer. The Employer is paid for his cucumbers by size grading; the Employer will pay the workers 44% of the total proceeds. Each bucket under this system equals one 5/8 U.S. bushel. At the end of the grading process, the total crews? earnings are determined for the day. The mix rate for the day will be determined by dividing the total number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked by the crew into the total earnings of the crew. The individual worker's earnings will be determined by the number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked that day times the determined mix rate. In no instance will a worker receive less than $.75 per 5/8 bu. bucket for each bucket picked over the course of a pay period. The estimated hourly earnings listed above for activities paid at piece rates are only estimates; they are not representations or guarantees that any worker will in fact earn the amounts shown. Persons working on a piece rate are guaranteed that their total earnings will be at least the applicable AEWR for all hours of piece work in the payroll period. If the Worker's piece-rate earnings for the hours worked at piece rate during a payroll period result in average hourly earnings of less than the guaranteed applicable hourly AEWR rate the Worker will be provided makeup pay to the guaranteed minimum hourly rate for the hours worked at the piece rate during the respective payroll period. continues || Workers may assist in removing tobacco from barn, placing on sheets to be bound &amp; loaded on trucks or may assist in baling tobacco by placing cured tobacco onto conveyor loading system or directly into baler. Weight of sheets of tobacco may be 300 lbs. Workers are required to work in fields when tobacco leaves are wet with dew or rain. If workers are required to work in light rain, rain gear will be provided at no cost to the workers. Worker will stand for prolonged periods of time to prime (pull) leaves which are from two (2) to ten (10) inches from the ground. Workers may be exposed to noxious plants or insects.

May walk behind transplanter to reset missing plants. Workers will chop out weeds with a hoe, or pull weeds by hand. Workers will remove tops &amp; suckers from plants. Workers using a tobacco knife will cut ripe plants off at ground level &amp; spear the tobacco stalk over metal spear onto wooden stick (stick is 48 inches long, one end is stuck in ground, &amp; metal spear is placed on other end). Industry standard is six (6) plants per stick (stick &amp; six (6) plants may weigh 80-100 pounds, &amp; plants may be seven (7) feet tall). Workers may drop sticks in standing tobacco before cutting by hand or by machine. Worker will transfer tobacco-loaded sticks from ground to wagon or trailer &amp; load sticks in orderly fashion on said wagon or trailer. Worker will then transfer sticks from wagon or trailer to other workers standing on rails in tobacco-curing barn. Workers standing on rails (worker stands with one foot on each rail -- rails may be 48 inches apart &amp; from 6 to 40 feet from ground) will either hang stick &amp; separate plants, or will transfer to another worker for purposes of air-curing the tobacco. For best results, curing barns should be filled in as short a time as possible.Care must be exercised to prevent bruising or breaking of plants &amp; leaves at all times. Care must also be exercised in using tobacco knife, spear, while standing on rails, &amp; stripping the crop. Workers will take great care when stripping (removing tobacco from the stick) the tobacco. The tobacco is taken down from the barn. The stalks with leaves are removed from the sticks &amp; piled under a piece of plastic to retain moisture (bulking down). Each worker pulls his assigned grade for the stalk &amp; passes the stalk down to fellow workers. When a worker gets a full hand, the tobacco is tied into ?hands? &amp; placed on a strip stick. May assist in baling tobacco by placing cured tobacco onto conveyor loading system or directly into baler. Burley tobacco work is paid the hourly adverse effect wage rate (AEWR).

The buyer's grading machine separates by size the pickles furnished by the Employer. The Employer is paid for his cucumbers by size grading; the Employer will pay the workers 44% of the total proceeds. Each bucket under this system equals one 5/8 U.S. bushel. At the end of the grading process, the total crews? earnings are determined for the day. The mix rate for the day will be determined by dividing the total number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked by the crew into the total earnings of the crew. The individual worker's earnings will be determined by the number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked that day times the determined mix rate. In no instance will a worker receive less than $.75 per 5/8 bu. bucket for each bucket picked over the course of a pay period.
