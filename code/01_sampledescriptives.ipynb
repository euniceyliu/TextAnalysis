As defined at 20 CFR 655.103(b) &amp; provided at 20 CFR 655.131(a-b) &amp; the North Carolina Growers Association is making this master Application for Temporary Employment Certification as a joint employer association with its employer members pursuant to the governing regulation at 20 CFR 655.131(a-b). The number of workers shown in Section A.2 of the ETA Form 790 is the aggregate number of foreign workers that will be employed by the association &amp; its employer members under this temporary employment certification application. The approximate maximum number of workers (foreign &amp; domestic) to be employed in the certified occupation by the individual employer member(s) of the association is shown in the Addendum (the list of employers). The numbers shown in the addendum are approximations provided for the convenience of governing administrative agencies. Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.131(a-b), all temporary labor certifications issued to the Association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its members. Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.131(b), workers authorized by the temporary labor certification may be transferred among its certified employer members to perform work for which the temporary labor certification was granted.

In instances when, in the employer's judgment, working conditions are unusually adverse, the employer may, in its discretion, temporarily raise the piece rate above the rates listed above, or may elect to pay workers at the applicable hourly AEWR rate, in order to assure workers fair earnings. None of the tasks listed above will be paid at less than the above-listed piece rates.           When picking pickle cucumbers each worker will be paid a minimum of $.75 per 5/8 bushel bucket for all buckets picked during the pay period &amp; will be guaranteed the AEWR; however the workers earnings will be based on the various sizes of the cucumbers picked each day by the total crew. Each bucket picked will include cucumbers of all marketable sizes. These full buckets picked by all pickers in the crew will be dumped in a common field bin. The worker will be given a token or ticket for each 5/8 bushel bucket dumped in the bin. The cucumbers will be taken to the grading station operated by the company that buys the pickles grown by the Employer. The buyer's grading machine separates by size the pickles furnished by the Employer. The Employer is paid for his cucumbers by size grading; the Employer will pay the workers 44% of the total proceeds. Each bucket under this system equals one 5/8 U.S. bushel. At the end of the grading process, the total crews? earnings are determined for the day. The mix rate for the day will be determined by dividing the total number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked by the crew into the total earnings of the crew. The individual worker's earnings will be determined by the number of 5/8 bushel buckets picked that day times the determined mix rate. In no instance will a worker receive less than $.75 per 5/8 bu. bucket for each bucket picked over the course of a pay period. The estimated hourly earnings listed above for activities paid at piece rates are only estimates; they are not representations or guarantees that any worker will in fact earn the amounts shown. Persons working on a piece rate are guaranteed that their total earnings will be at least the applicable AEWR for all hours of piece work in the payroll period. If the Worker's piece-rate earnings for the hours worked at piece rate during a payroll period result in average hourly earnings of less than the guaranteed applicable hourly AEWR rate the Worker will be provided makeup pay to the guaranteed minimum hourly rate for the hours worked at the piece rate during the respective payroll period. continues || Workers may assist in removing tobacco from barn, placing on sheets to be bound &amp; loaded on trucks or may assist in baling tobacco by placing cured tobacco onto conveyor loading system or directly into baler.
