The Worker will not be required by the Employer to purchase any health care benefit or participate in any retirement benefit that may be offered and may choose to state in writing that the worker declines to purchase any such Employer sponsored health care or retirement benefit. If the Worker timely chooses to purchase any such benefit, at the time the Worker states his or her desire to purchase such a health care benefit by completing and submitting any required written application any such benefit, the Worker also will be required to authorize a once a month deduction from the Worker's wages to pay the Worker's portion of the monthly premium. Such authorization by a Worker for the Employer to make a bi-monthly deduction for wages, that is for the deduction to be made from wages paid on each payday from the workers' wages to pay the workers portion of the monthly premium or deduction.

Additionally, information concerning the amount that the worker may contribute to any retirement plan will be provided in writing if such benefit is offered. Any offered health or retirement plans shall be governed by the terms of any such plan, the requirement of any insurance company or third-party administrator as well as payroll administration requirements. No deduction not required by law will be made that brings the worker's hourly earnings below the FLSA Federal statutory minimum wage, except and unless allowed by law. || Employee Expectations and Behavior Continued:13.\\tAll posters required by federal and state law will be posted at each housing location.  They are not to be removed, defaced, or altered in any way.  Workers who wish to have copies may ask their supervisor.14.\\tAll housing must be locked each morning before leaving for work.  Lights and unnecessary heat should be turned off; doors and windows closed in event of rain and when heat is turned on.15.\\tWorkers living in employer's housing assigned to bunk beds may not separate bunk beds, as floor space in sleeping rooms is needed by all occupants.16.\\tWorkers living in employer's housing may not cook in sleeping rooms or any other non-kitchen areas.  Employer furnishes cooking facilities and equipment.17.\\tWorkers may not drop paper, cans, bottles and other trash in fields, work areas, or on housing premises.  Trash and waste receptacles must be used, and lids must be kept on trash and waste receptacles.18.\\tWorkers may not take unauthorized breaks from work.19.\\tWorkers may not leave the field or other assigned work areas without permission of employer or person in charge.20.\\tWorkers may not enter employer's premises without authorization.21.\\tWorkers may not begin work prior to scheduled starting time or continue working after stopping time.22.\\tWorkers living in employer's housing may not entertain guests in housing premises after 10 p.m. Sunday through Friday or after 11 p.m. on Saturday and may not have overnight guests at any time 23.\\tWorkers may not deliberately restrict production or damage plants.24.\\tAny worker who physically threatens another worker, the employer, or any supervisor, with or without any tool or weapon, will be subject to immediate discharge.25.\\tAny worker who is found carrying, using or possessing any dangerous or deadly weapon will be subject to immediate discharge.  26.\\tWorkers may not engage in horse play, scuffling, throwing things, wasting time, or loitering, including sitting in work vans or other equipment during work hours.  Workers will be discharged for fighting on the employer's premises, including housing premises, at any time.27.\\tWorkers will be discharged if they steal from fellow workers or the employer.28.\\tWorkers will not falsify identification, personnel, medical, production or other related records.29.\\tWorkers may not willfully or negligently abuse or destroy any machinery, truck or other vehicle, equipment, tools, or other property, including housing belonging to the employer or to other employees.30.\\tWorkers must not engage in discriminatory or unlawful harassment.  Such harassment of co-workers, visitors, vendors or others because of any protected status, including race, sex, ethnicity, age, national origin, country of origin, and other categories protected by applicable provisions is forbidden.  Workers must report potential violations to their supervisor or to the employer's office.31.\\tWorkers will be charged for reasonable costs related to the workers' refusal or reckless failure to return property of the employer or due to such worker's willful or reckless damage or destruction of such property.  32.\\tHousing assignments will be made exclusively by the employer.  Workers may occupy only the housing to which they are assigned.  Workers may only sleep in rooms, areas, or units as assigned by the employer or designated supervisor.  Workers may not reassign themselves nor switch housing assignments with other workers. || Employee Expectations and Behavior8.\\tNo use of beer or liquor is permitted during work time or during any workday before work is completed for the day (such as during meals); workers may not report for work under the influence of beer, liquor or illegal drugs, which includes abuse of prescription drugs prescribed for either the worker or for another person.  Employees may be terminated for excessive use of alcohol, drunk and/or disorderly conduct in housing after hours.  Illegal drugs may not be used, sold, manufactured or kept on any employer premises, including housing.  Prescription medication must be kept in its original container with the original pharmacy label attached.  Employer will test for drug or alcohol use upon reasonable suspicion that the worker may be affected by drugs or alcohol that could adversely affect job performance or the work environment, including safety related performance of the worker or other persons.  9.\\tExcessive absences or tardiness will not be permitted.  This is regular, everyday work for which employees are expected to be present, able and willing to perform every scheduled workday.  This is not sporadic or \"day work.\"  Excessive or repeated tardiness is not acceptable.  Excessive absences or tardiness includes three (3) unexcused absences and/or tardies in a two (2) week period and may result in termination.  Less frequent rates of unexcused absence and tardiness that negatively impact operations and productivity, such as one unexcused absence or tardy per week for consecutive weeks, will result in less severe discipline such as a written warning or suspension.  Failure to correct such attendance issues will result in termination.    10.\\tAny absence and/or tardiness that is requested at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the work start day and time for which approval from the worker's supervisor is obtained will not count as an unexcused absence.  Absences for verifiable medical reasons or other emergency reasons that can be substantiated with verification will also not count as unexcused absences.  Employer reserves the right, however, to terminate workers absent for any reason if the number of absences materially effects operations and productivity if the absences are not subject to the Family Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or similar applicable provisions.11.\\tWorkers must maintain any living quarters provided to them clean and in good repair, given reasonable wear and tear, in compliance with applicable housing requirements as determined by regular inspections by the employer and government representatives.  For example, eggs, meats, and other foods requiring refrigeration must remain refrigerated, dishes and other cooking utensils must be cleaned, and lids must be kept on all trash and waste receptacles.  The Employer may inspect housing for compliance with these requirements at reasonable times, and workers must report any damage or maintenance issues, whether by normal wear and tear, or by acts of an individual to their supervisor or the employer's office.  Workers shall cooperate in maintaining common kitchen and living areas.  No pets of any kind are permitted.12.\\tReasonable repair costs of damage other than that caused by normal wear and tear will be charged to the workers found to have been responsible for the willful or reckless damage to the housing or furnishings as allowable by State and Federal law.  Such conduct may result in termination.     || All workers that have a valid driver's license must agree to and comply with the employer's fleet policy agreement prior to driving any company vehicles. Workers shall not drive a company vehicle unless written permission is provided to employee. Workers may be offered a bonus of up to $100.00 for becoming a Farm Labor Contractor Employee (hereinafter referred to as FLCE). All workers will be paid for hours in obtaining their FLCE license. Drivers may be entitled to additional compensation for properly maintaining company vehicles. Drivers will be paid drive time hours at the Average Earning Wage Rate (AEWR) for the state in which work is performed.  || Merit based bonuses may be given. Higher hourly rate may be given based on experience, tenure, skill, and other non-discriminatory factors. If any advances are given to workers, it will be deducted from their checks as allowable by Federal and State Law. Any willful destruction of property will also be deducted by Federal and State Law. All drivetime hours will be paid at the AEWR when the work is being performed.  || Although not intended to be a complete list, these work rules are intended to provide guidance to workers of standards of conduct expected of them.Notice is provided that violation of lawful job-related employer requirements, including these work rules, will be considered grounds for immediate termination of a worker's employment.  Penalties such as suspension from work opportunity for the remainder of the day to three (3) days may be made in the case of less serious violations.Workers are expected to comply with all rules relating to discipline, attendance, work quality and effort, and the care and maintenance of all property provided to them by the employer.Safety/ Production StandardWorkers will be expected to meet the following production standards after completion of training or break-in period, if applicable: Adequately skilled and safe use of nail gun, screw gun, measuring tape, saws, and other skills needed to meet the necessary time and safety requirements of the schedule.1.\\tWorkers who perform sloppy work may be suspended without pay for the remainder of a workday or for up to three days in the sole judgment of their supervisor, depending on the degree of infraction, the worker's prior record and other relevant factors.  Discharge of the worker may result from any subsequent offense.2.\\tWorkers may not use or operate trucks or other vehicles, machines, tools or other equipment and property to which the worker has not been specifically assigned by his supervisor and with proper licensing.  Workers may not use or operate trucks or other vehicles, tools or other equipment or property for their personal use unless expressly authorized by the employer.3.\\tWorkers must not misuse or remove any employer owned property from the farm premises without authorization.4.\\tWorkers must obey all safety rules and common safety practices and must report any injuries or accidents promptly to their supervisor or the employer's office.

Employer may terminate a worker for lawful job-related reasons and notify the Job Service local office if the worker: (1) abandons employment (five consecutive workdays of unexcused absence); (2) malingers or otherwise refuses, without cause, to perform the work as directed; (3) commits serious act(s) of misconduct or repeatedly violates the Work Rules; (4) fails, after completing the allowable three day training period or five day trial period (whichever is applicable), to perform in a competent and skillful manner that enables the employer to produce and sell a premium quality product; and/or (5) provides other lawful job-related reasons for termination, including termination of a non-US worker because a US worker becomes available for the job under the DOL 50% rule.  Regardless of whether the employer requires a background check as a condition of employment, the employer may terminate for cause, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, any worker found during the period of employment to have a criminal conviction record or status as a registered sex offender  that the employer reasonably believes will endanger the safety or welfare of other workers, company staff, customers, or the public at large. || Work is to be done in the field for long periods of time.

Employer requires all newly-hired employees to take and pass an employer-paid drug test before starting work. Drug test not required for prospective applicants prior to hiring decision. All testing is conducted uniformly after an initial job offer has been extended and accepted by the new hire.  Workers testing positive will be immediately terminated and paid for all hours worked between the first date of employment and the date of termination, if any. In the case of a non-local or foreign worker who is terminated for failure to pass a drug test, the employer will arrange least-cost transportation to the worker's place of recruitment, at the worker's expense. The employer will also test after a worker has an accident at work. || Unless paid in advance, inbound travel costs reimbursed with pay for the first workweek to the extent that worker’s out-of-pocket expenses reduce earnings below FLSA minimum wage; remainder of travel costs reimbursed upon completion of 50% of the contract period, per 20 CFR 655.122(h)(1).  Employer provides or pays outbound travel costs to workers who complete the contract period or are dismissed early.

All travel reimbursements are based on worker’s actual cost but shall not exceed the least-cost economy rate. || Employer requires all newly hired employees to take and pass an employer-paid background check.  All background checks are conducted uniformly after an initial job offer has been extended and accepted by the new hire.  Applicants found to have felony convictions (including, but not limited to assault, child molestation, sex or drug-related convictions) will be immediately terminated out of concern for general public safety, and paid for all hours worked between the first date of employment and the date of termination, if any. In the case of a foreign worker who is terminated for cause resulting from findings of the background check, the employer will arrange least-cost transportation to the worker's place of recruitment, at the worker's expense.     Persons seeking employment in this position must be available for the entire period requested by the employer. All workers will be subject to a trial period of up to five days during which the employer will evaluate workers' performance of required tasks. Employer reserves the right to terminate a worker if the employer reasonably finds worker's performance during the trial period to be unacceptable.
